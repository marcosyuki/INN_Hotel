# INN Hotel: Booking Cancellation Prediction

## Business Overview 
INN Hotels Group has a chain of hotels in Portugal. They are facing problems with the high number of booking cancellations. 

## Objective
The task at hand is to analyze the data provided, to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.

## Key Skills
`Logistic Regression`
`Decision Tree`
